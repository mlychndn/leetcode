I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our recent correspondence regarding the discrepancy in counts when utilizing the facet option in the Google Cloud Search API.

Firstly, I appreciate your prompt response and the suggestion to use the facet percentage workaround. However, after implementing this workaround as per the provided guidance, we regret to inform you that the issue persists on our end. The facet percentage does not seem to align with the expected counts, and we are experiencing challenges in reconciling the discrepancies.

To provide more context, we have thoroughly reviewed our implementation to ensure that we are following the recommended practices and incorporating the facet percentage as outlined in the documentation. Despite these efforts, the count results remain inconsistent and do not reflect the accurate representation of the data.

We understand that resolving such issues can be complex, and we greatly appreciate your ongoing support. In light of the continued challenges we are facing, we would be grateful for any additional insights or alternative approaches that could help address this matter.

If there are specific troubleshooting steps, updates, or best practices that we may have overlooked, please guide us accordingly. Your expertise is crucial to ensuring the accuracy of our search results, and we are committed to working collaboratively to identify and resolve the root cause of this discrepancy.

Thank you once again for your time and attention to this matter. We look forward to your guidance and appreciate your assistance in helping us achieve a resolution.
